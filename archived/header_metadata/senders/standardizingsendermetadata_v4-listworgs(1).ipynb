      "This valve is normally located two feet in from the street curb. From there to the house\n",

      "\n",
      "Why doesn’t the city at least replace its portion of lead service lines?\n",
      "\n",
      "Partial lead service line replacement has been shown to mobilize more lead and make\n",

      "\n",
      "What is the City’s timeline for installation of corrosion control treatment?\n",
      "\n",
      "The federal government allows the steps to complete the installation of optimal\n",
      "corrosion control treatment and follow-up monitoring to take up to five years.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the City of Flint has committed to completing installation of Optimized\n",
      "Corrosion Control Treatment in less than six months.\n",
      "\n",
      "What will happen when Flint joins the Karegnondi Water Authority next year?\n",
      "The City has committed to having Optimized Corrosion Control Treatment in place prior\n",

      "How long would it take to replace lead service lines throughout Flint?\n",

      "The city has about 32,900 service connections in total. More than 15,000 of these\n",
      "connections are considered lead service lines. Even if many crews were contracted, it\n",
      "would likely take up to 15 years to complete this work.\n",
      "\n",
      "What would it cost to replace the lead service line at my house?\n",
      "\n",
      "Average costs to replace a lead service line at an individual home range from $2,000 to\n",
      "$8,000. Costs vary depending on the length and size of service line that is needed, as\n",
      "well as the ground cover and soil conditions encountered.\n",

      "Health and Human Services, regularly monitors blood levels in children throughout\n",
      "Michigan communities. The leading cause of lead poisoning is exposure to lead paint.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blood lead level testing results for the 12-month period just after the City of Flint\n",
      "changed its water source (May 2014 — April 2015) showed no significant change in the\n",
      "pattern of blood lead levels in Flint, compared to the previous three years. This data\n",
      "suggests the recent change in water source by the City of Flint has not contributed to an\n",
      "increase in lead exposure throughout the community.\n",
      "\n",
      "How does the state decide if the water is creating a lead problem?\n",
      "\n",
      "Compliance with the federal lead rule is based on a 90™ percentile calculation. If more\n",
      "than 10 percent of samples report lead above the federal action level of 15 parts per\n",
      "billion, a water supply has an “action level exceedance.” An exceedance is not a\n",

      "\n",
      "While some of Flint's individual samples exceeded the 15 parts-per-billion lead action\n",
      "level, compliance is based on the 90™ percentile of samples. The City of Flint's 90\n",
      "percentile level has ranged between 0 parts per billion in 2008 and 2011, and 15 parts\n",

      "The more time water has been sitting in your home's pipes, the more lead it may\n",

      "\"flush\" cold-water pipes by running the water until it becomes as cold as it will get. This\n",
      "could take five to 30 seconds if there has been recent water use elsewhere in the home,\n",
      "such as showering or flushing toilets. Otherwise, it could take two minutes or longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Use only water from the cold-water tap for drinking, cooking, and especially for making\n",

      "What You Should Know About Lead Service Line Flushing\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lansing Board of Water & Light (LBWL) recently embarked upon several initiatives\n",
      "designed to provide customers with the best information on minimizing exposure to lead\n",
      "in drinking water. They did so in the face of heightened public scrutiny of their lead\n",
      "monitoring program in the wake of widely reported problems experienced by the\n",
      "Washington D.C., water system with lead monitoring and lead service line replacement\n",
      "programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the LBWL initiatives was designed to determine the time needed for a typical\n",
      "resident with a lead service line to flush their kitchen tap until the lead level in the\n",
      "drinking water is reduced to background levels (< 3 ppb). The LBWL hired consultants\n",
      "Malcolm & Pimie, Inc to conduct this assessment. Consecutive 1 liter samples were\n",
      "collected from 30 Lansing homes with lead service lines after an overnight period of\n",
      "stagnation. These samples were analyzed to determine when water flowing from the tap\n",
      "no longer contained lead that had presumably leached from fixtures, household\n",
      "plumbing, or the service line.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result of this study, LBWL issued new flushing guidelines for its customers with lead\n",
      "service lines. Customers are now being advised to flush their kitchen tap for a minimum\n",
      "of 7 minutes when it has been stagnant for 6 or more hours. This recommendation is\n",
      "extremely cautious and goes well beyond all advice currently being given by EPA, which\n",
      "currently states that flushing for up to 2 minutes may be sufficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "The LBWL recognizes that flushing for 7 minutes may not always be convenient or\n",
      "practical, so in conjunction with the new flushing guidelines, they are offering free water\n",
      "filters and replacement cartridges to customers who have lead service lines. Customers\n",
      "may install this filter on the primary tap used for consumption so that flushing will be\n",
      "unnecessary. A free blood lead test is also available through the county health\n",
      "department for customers participating in the lead service line sampling program.\n",
      "\n",
      "It should be emphasized that the LBWL has never exceeded the lead action level in\n",
      "compliance monitoring. Nonetheless, they committed to replacing all 14,000 known or\n",
      "suspected lead service lines by the year 2014 at an estimated cost of $35 million. At\n",
      "this point, the LBWL has about 13,000 lead service lines remaining.\n",
      "\n",
      "The DEQ is providing you with this information today so that other water systems with\n",
      "lead service lines remaining in their system may be well informed and prepared to\n",
      "answer any questions that may arise about what the LBWL has done and what your\n",
      "utility is doing in comparison. We are not advocating that you alter your current flushing\n",
      "guidance, only that you be aware that EPA and other references may soon start\n",
      "recommending flushing for longer periods than currently published. We also urge you to\n",
