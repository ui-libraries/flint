      "Ron English, Deputy General Counsel, Seattle Public Schools\n",
      "\n",
      "The second case study was presented by Ron English and focused on the experiences of the\n",
      "Seattle School District. The district has faced many challenges related to lead in drinking water in the\n",
      "past year, but was finally able to adopt a new policy on December 1, 2004.\n",
      "\n",
      "Background\n",
      "\n",
      "The Seattle School District is an inner-city district (42 percent of 47,000 students qualify for free\n",
      "or reduced lunch) with an aging stock of buildings. They purchase their water from Seattle Public\n",
      "Utilities. In 1991-1992 lead testing was conducted. About 25 percent of drinking water fountains were\n",
      "found to exceed 20 ppb. The bubblers at these fountains were replaced, but not the plumbing. A flushing\n",
      "program was instituted, but was not consistently applied. Recommendations that the plumbing at 4\n",
      "schools in the district be replaced were not implemented due to levy failures. The results of the testing\n",
      "were never made public and no action was taken from 1992 until 2003.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2003, parents became aware of and publicized problems with iron in school water. Testing\n",
      "also exposed elevated lead levels. High lead fevels were found in a kindergarten classroom. One student\n",
      "was reported to have become ill after she was introduced to the classroom and improved afier she lefi;\n",
      "however, she was never tested for lead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Action\n",
      "\n",
      "The school district immediately provided bottled water for all schools over 7 years old (60\n",
      "schools) and hired a consuitant to create a comprehensive testing program for the district. Testing took\n",
      "place at all schools (included testing for lead, cadmium, iron, copper, E. Coli, color and turbidity). A\n",
      "decision was made that water was not to be consumed from any fountain/tap until testing showed that it\n",
      "was safe. Water from drinking fountains in hallways, classrooms, and sinks were tested after an 18-hour\n",
      "period of stagnation following flushing. Testing indicated lead over 20 ppb in 25% of locations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The testing program revealed lead levels rebound tfo their original levels in just 2-3 hours, so a\n",
      "drinking fountain must be used frequently throughout the day to keep levels down. Replacing the bubbler\n",
      "didn’t completely solve the problem because the 250-mL test samples also drew water from 7-feet of\n",
      "piping behind the fountain. In the summer of 2004 the plumbing was replaced at the 4 schools where this\n",
      "had been recommended in the 1990's.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the kitchens in the district use pre-packaged foods and therefore use minimal water.\n",
      "These taps were not considered high priority. Age-appropriate warning signs have been posted in all\n",
      "restrooms warning children not to drink the water from these taps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Letters were sent to every parent in the district.\n",
      "Iron Removal\n",
      "\n",
      "Iron was the original problem that brought water quality issues to light in 2003. Now, the iron\n",
      "standard for Seattle Public Schools is almost as strict as that used for public water systems. One option\n",
      "for removing high iron is to install filters. It was determined that drinking water filters work at about half\n",
      "the rated capacity. They tend to clog after a few hundred gallons and therefore cannot be relied upon for\n",
