      "\n",
      "- The department cannot provide food, using appropriated funds, for any meeting less than 5 hours in length. Private partners would likely need to be approached for\n",

      "\n",
      "- Any need for private consultants would need to be included. Consulting fees have a very large range - from hundreds to thousands of dollars, depending on their\n",
      "specialty. | would estimate about $2,000 per consultant at a minimum, excluding travel costs. With those costs, it could total about $3,500 per consultant (with air\n",
      "fare, hotel room, and meals.)\n",
      "\n",
      "- Materials and supplies, including printing costs for the final report, will be variable. | would assume at least another $3,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "- DHS staff support would be provided using existing resources for the Michigan Domestic and Sexual Violence Prevention and Treatment Board.\n",
      "\n",
      "The items above, excluding the systems costs, would be about $25,000 maximum annually. Systems costs can range dramatically, even for the creation of a\n",

      "Ron English, Deputy General Counsel, Seattle Public Schools\n",
      "\n",
      "The second case study was presented by Ron English and focused on the experiences of the\n",
      "Seattle School District. The district has faced many challenges related to lead in drinking water in the\n",
      "past year, but was finally able to adopt a new policy on December 1, 2004.\n",
      "\n",
      "Background\n",
      "\n",
      "The Seattle School District is an inner-city district (42 percent of 47,000 students qualify for free\n",
      "or reduced lunch) with an aging stock of buildings. They purchase their water from Seattle Public\n",
      "Utilities. In 1991-1992 lead testing was conducted. About 25 percent of drinking water fountains were\n",
      "found to exceed 20 ppb. The bubblers at these fountains were replaced, but not the plumbing. A flushing\n",
      "program was instituted, but was not consistently applied. Recommendations that the plumbing at 4\n",
      "schools in the district be replaced were not implemented due to levy failures. The results of the testing\n",
      "were never made public and no action was taken from 1992 until 2003.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2003, parents became aware of and publicized problems with iron in school water. Testing\n",
      "also exposed elevated lead levels. High lead fevels were found in a kindergarten classroom. One student\n",
      "was reported to have become ill after she was introduced to the classroom and improved afier she lefi;\n",
      "however, she was never tested for lead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Action\n",
      "\n",
      "The school district immediately provided bottled water for all schools over 7 years old (60\n",
      "schools) and hired a consuitant to create a comprehensive testing program for the district. Testing took\n",
      "place at all schools (included testing for lead, cadmium, iron, copper, E. Coli, color and turbidity). A\n",
      "decision was made that water was not to be consumed from any fountain/tap until testing showed that it\n",
      "was safe. Water from drinking fountains in hallways, classrooms, and sinks were tested after an 18-hour\n",
      "period of stagnation following flushing. Testing indicated lead over 20 ppb in 25% of locations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The testing program revealed lead levels rebound tfo their original levels in just 2-3 hours, so a\n",
      "drinking fountain must be used frequently throughout the day to keep levels down. Replacing the bubbler\n",
      "didn’t completely solve the problem because the 250-mL test samples also drew water from 7-feet of\n",
      "piping behind the fountain. In the summer of 2004 the plumbing was replaced at the 4 schools where this\n",
      "had been recommended in the 1990's.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the kitchens in the district use pre-packaged foods and therefore use minimal water.\n",
      "These taps were not considered high priority. Age-appropriate warning signs have been posted in all\n",
      "restrooms warning children not to drink the water from these taps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Letters were sent to every parent in the district.\n",
      "Iron Removal\n",
      "\n",
      "Iron was the original problem that brought water quality issues to light in 2003. Now, the iron\n",
      "standard for Seattle Public Schools is almost as strict as that used for public water systems. One option\n",
      "for removing high iron is to install filters. It was determined that drinking water filters work at about half\n",
      "the rated capacity. They tend to clog after a few hundred gallons and therefore cannot be relied upon for\n",
      "the entire year.\n",

      "\n",
      "My major questions:\n",
      "1. Several agencies and officials are involved - can you clarify DEQ's role in the Flint water\n",
      "situation?\n",
      "\n",
      "The City of Flint water system is one of over 1400 Community Water Systems in Michigan regulated\n",
      "under the Michigan Safe Drinking Water Act {1976 Public Act 399, as amended), which incorporates\n",
      "reguirements of the federai Safe Drinking Water Act. The DEQ Office of Drinking Water and Municipal\n",
      "Assistance has been given authority for oversight of these regulations. DEQ regulatory oversight is\n",
      "mainly conducted through inspections, review of monitoring information (this includes sampie results\n",
      "and operations data), issuance of construction permits for water systems, and planning (reliability,\n",
      "emergency response, capital improvement, operation and maintenance, etc.) As both community water\n",
      "systems and the DEQ desire the mutual goal of safe water, the DEQ works proactively in partnership\n",
      "with water systems to provide compliance assistance. This also includes activities such as source water\n",
      "protection and infrastructure funding.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. What is the DEQ's response to the mayor's request for assistance?\n",
      "\n",
      "As indicated by phone this letter was directed to the Governor’s Office and should be followed up with\n",
      "that office for response at this point in time.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. What on-going testing is DEQ doing with Flint water and how often?\n",
      "\n",
      "The City is required to follow all state and federal monitoring reguirements under Act 399. This includes\n",
      "sample analysis of over 80 contaminants with health based drinking water standards along with\n",
      "monitoring of its source, treatment, and distribution operations. Sample analysis frequency is based on\n",
      "the specific contaminant type, its level of detection if any, and its potential variability.\n",
      "\n",
      "in regards to total coliform and e.coli bacteria compliance monitoring, the City is required to analyze at\n",
      "least 100 samples each monthiy compliance period from its distribution system.\n",
      "\n",
      "In regards to Total Trihalomethane {TTHM) compliance monitoring, the City is required to collect\n",
      "guarterly samples from 8 locations in its distribution system. The TTHM standard is based on a Running\n",
      "Annual Average for each of the 8 locations, rather than individual sample results. The location and\n",

      "A response at this point may be moot as Flint and Genesee Co. already held a press conference\n",
      "yesterday rejecting the DWSD offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "It Is also unclear whether DWSD provided its offer directly to Flint and Genesee Co. by the deadline in\n",
      "Treasurer Dillon’s letter. However, Flint and Genesee Co. still took the offer under consideration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our office concurs with both Flint and Genesee Co. that the offers provided by DWSD were incomplete.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the two scenarios provided by DWSD it appeared that only Scenario 2 was listed as potentially being\n",
      "more cost effective. However, this scenario did not address the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The DWSD scenarios are based on 40 MGD of service capacity. However, the KWA project is\n",
      "providing 60 MGD of initial capacity with potential expansion to 75 MGD in the\n",
      "future. Therefore, in order for a more direct comparison the DWSD scenario would need to\n",
      "increase capacity to 60 MGD, which would increase fixed rate commodity costs as well as the\n",
      "capital costs for the Huron Plant that DWSD was planning to allocate to Flint and Genesee Co.,\n",
      "presumably by as much as 50%.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. DWSD proposals cover a 30 year period to 2042, but fail to recognize that after this period bond\n",
      "payments for the KWA project will be complete and result in a significant reduction in costs for\n",
      "the KWA option. '\n",
      "\n",
      "3. While DWSD indicates that Flint and Genesee Co. would be given “broadened representation”, it\n",
      "remains unclear exactly what this means in terms of actual control in the decision making\n",
      "process.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. This scenario continues to rely on a single transmission system and would require the City of\n",
      "Flint to maintain its WTP for emergency purposes and these costs do not appear to be\n",
      "included. In addition, use of the Flint WTP as an emergency backup would leave Genesee Co.\n",
      "without an adequate backup supply to meet their 30 year needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, without DWSD providing the specific details of these proposals, it is difficult to provide a true\n",
      "comparative analysis, and as such Flint and Genesee Co. appear to be justified in their rejection of these\n",

      "\n",
      "Key Points for Nutrition and Lead\n",
      "\n",
      "* The human body's nutritional status affects the absorption, deposition, and excretion of lead\n",
      "and may also affect lead toxicity.\n",
      "\n",
      "» Lead exposure can also modify the body’s ability to utilize nutrients.\n",
      "\n",
      "« Avoidance of lead exposure remains the primary preventive strategy for reducing adverse\n",
      "health effects. However, the existence of nutrient-lead interactions suggests that optimiz-\n",
      "ing nutritional status during pregnancy and lactation may assist in preventing the adverse\n",
      "consequences of lead exposure.\n",
      "\n",
      "General Nutritional Recommendations for Pregnant and Lactating Women\n",
      "\n",
      "« All pregnant and lactating women should eat a balanced diet in order to maintain adequate\n",
      "amounts of vitamins, nutrients, and minerals.\n",
      "\n",
      "e All pregnant and lactating women should be evaluated for iron status and be provided with\n",
      "supplementation in order to correct iron deficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "« All pregnant and lactating women should be evaluated for the adequacy of their diets and\n",
      "be provided with appropriate nutritional advice and prenatal vitamins.\n",
      "\n",
      "» Women in need of assistance should be referred to programs, such as WIC or the Supplemen-\n",
      "tal Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) (formerly food stamps).\n",
      "\n",
      "« All pregnant and lactating women should avoid the use of alcohol, cigarettes, herbal medi-\n",
      "cines, and any other substance that may adversely affect the developing fetus or infant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendations for Pregnant and Lactating Women with Blood Lead Levels =25 pug/dL\n",
      "\n",
      "e [n pregnant and lactating women with BLLs =5 pg/dL or with a history of lead exposure, a\n",
      "dietary calcium intake of 2,000 milligrams daily should be maintained, either through diet or\n",
      "in combination with supplementation.\n",
      "\n",
      "OVERVIEW OF THE RELATION BETWEEN NUTRITION AND LEAD\n",
      "\n",
      "Pregnancy and the first 2 years of life are exceptionally important intervals with respect to adequate maternal\n",
      "and child nutrition (Horton 2008). Pregnancy and lactation are also critically important periods from a toxico-\n",
      "logical perspective because of the special significance of the potential for adverse effects of toxic exposures\n",
      "on early human development. If inadequate nutritional status increases susceptibility to the toxic effects of\n",
      "lead, lifelong adverse effects are more likely. In addition, lead exposure can interfere with the metabolism of\n",
      "nutrients—an especially important consideration when nutritional status is marginal. This chapter provides an\n",
      "overview of the information on dietary intake and lead levels in pregnant women. These data are limited. Any\n",
      "beneficial effects of dietary supplementation must be demonstrated in well-designed (randomized, placebo-\n",
      "controlled) clinical trials. However, given the importance of basic nutrition in normal pregnancy and lactation,\n",
      "this chapter provides practical recommendations based on the limited suggestive data available for primary\n",
      "and secondary prevention of lead exposure. Recommended dietary intakes (dietary reference intakes [DRIs]—\n",
      "formerly called RDAs) are from the Institute of Medicine, Food and Nutrition Board, unless specifically noted\n",
      "otherwise, and are provided for reference as Appendix XliI (Institute of Medicine 1997, 2001).\n",

      "Since Flint switched its water source to the Flint River, officials have seen a spike in the number of cases of a severe form\n",
      "of pneumonia, called Legionnaires' disease — but officials say they're still looking for the cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "There have been 87 cases in Genesee County from June 2014 to November 2015 — and 10 of those cases resulted in\n",

      "That number is a jump from previous few years, when the county saw between 6 and 13 cases. It’s not clear how many\n",
      "were fatal.\n",
      "\n",
      "While state officials said they couldn’t make a connection between the water and the spike in disease, a drinking water\n",
      "expert who studied Flint said the rise in cases was “dramatic,” and added there’s a “very strong likelihood” the river’s\n",

      "e Hardness varies seasonally with higher hardness and alkalinity in the winter\n",
      "e Hardness, alkalinity, magnesium concentrations tend to be reduced by run-off\n",
      "\n",
      "In development of the 2002 Treatability Study, processes were simulated which resulted\n",

      "\n",
      "An earlier post by the same researchers says that initial water tests show “a serious lead in water problem” in Flint,\n",

      "early postpartum (see Table 8-3). In general, maternal blood lead levels decline after a course of chelation and\n",

      "also received BAL in addition to CaNa,EDTA. A single case reported the exclusive use of DMSA. In all cases,\n",
      "CaNa,EDTA therapy was associated with a decline in maternal blood lead levels. There was no change in\n",
      "maternal blood lead after the one case of treatment with DMSA (18-day course). However, she was treated as\n",
      "outpatient without apparent oversight for either compliance or ongoing lead exposure. In all but one case a\n",
      "healthy newborn was delivered. The exception occurred in a case where maternal blood lead pretreatment\n",
      "was 104 ug/dL. The woman received CaNa,EDTA and BAL. The 1.6 kg infant was born prematurely after an-\n",
      "tepartum hemorrhage 36 hours into treatment. This baby was later noted to have developmental delay and\n",
      "hearing deficit. No consistent pattern in cord blood lead levels was apparent in the few cases where they were\n",
      "reported. The interval between chelation and delivery also varied from months to minutes. Cord blood lead\n",
      "levels were higher than maternal blood lead in the case treated with DMSA and in that of the sick premature\n",
      "infant described. In the other cases cord blood lead levels were lower than maternal prechelation levels. In sev-\n",
      "eral reports, chelation treatment was not initiated until shortly before or soon after delivery and was directed\n",
      "toward the newborns. Various drugs at full dosages have been used singly or in combination: CaNa,EDTA\n",

      "\n",
      "The purpose of the report is to inform residents about blood lead level testing efforts in\n",
      "Flint and provides cumulative total numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not intended to be a technical report but a technical description, and further\n",

      "\n",
      "= Lead exposure for children younger than 6 is of particular concern\n",

      "\n",
      "Thank you for the work you have already done in my city to protect families from water contaminant exposure.\n",
      "I am a Flint resident, pregnant with my first child, and therefore advised to drink a whopping 10-16 cups of\n",
      "water each day. I am writing to see if you can shed some light or point me to another source for answers\n",
      "regarding water testing and the safest option for staying hydrated.\n",

      "If your wife or sister or friend were living in Flint and pregnant, what course of action would you recommend\n",
      "she take? Here is my situation:\n",
      "\n",
      "o A little background: Prior to becoming pregnant, 1 installed a pur advanced water filter on our kitchen\n",
      "faucet and always use it when drinking from the tap, which 1 do frequently. (According to the pur\n",
      "website, the filter is said to filter out 70+ chemicals. Recently, I contacted the company to request more -\n",
      "information on exactly what chemicals are filtered and up to what level, and am awaiting their reply.)\n",
      "When using the filter, the water is crystal clear, free of the river smell and without the slight yellow\n",
      "tinge that we sometimes have coming out of the tap (unlike in our bathroom sink which I use to brush\n",
      "my teeth...). I was compelled to purchase the filter because my legs began to swell after Flint changed\n",
      "to the river water, and after installing the filter this problem went away. I even tested the difference by\n",
      "drinking filtered water some days (consistently no swelling) and and unfiltered water others (consistent\n",
      "swelling) for a week or two. I understand the swelling to be the result of sodium chloride in our water\n",
      "which is corrosive enough to make GM stop using Flint water in their local plant\n",

      "(http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2014/10/general motors wont use flint.html)\n",
      "\n",
      "o Given your findings of high levels of lead in some residents' water, my husband strongly believes that I\n",
      "should cease drinking all Flint water and drink bottled water instead. However, I have read extensively\n",
      "about safety concerns of plastic-bottled water (chemists who work with plastics avoid drinking it) and\n",
      "this does not seem to be a safer option despite frequent bottled water drives organized by well-meaning\n",
      "activists across Flint.\n",
      "\n",
      "o I would like to test our house's tap water with and without the kitchen filter using an independent lab,\n",
      "but my husband thinks this will be a futile effort because we have no reliable way of knowing if the\n",
      "results on one day will be consistent with results on other days, such as if the City of Flint were doing\n",
      "some special change to the water treatment procedure. Would testing multiple times across several\n",

      "many Great Lakes states. Michigan’s four suppliers report that they depleted their\n",

      "they requested increased.\n",

      "A review of road salt contracting in eight other Midwest states indicates that road\n",
      "salt prices increased as the states’ bids were opened between May and July 2014.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, the later the bid was opened, the higher the price of salt. This\n",
      "timing issue is consistent with salt suppliers having insufficient inventories to cover\n",
      "the demand.\n",

      "higher in a greater number of areas than usual. If they win the higher priced bids,\n",
