      "investigation in their home to identify lead exposures, which could be lead from paint, soil,\n",
      "plumbing, and other sources.\n",
      "\n",

      "two for the Medicaid population, MDHHS has recommended blood lead testing for any child\n",
      "younger than six years of age in Flint who has not previously been tested. The state, in\n",
      "coordination with GCHD, developed and issued a Health Alert Network (HAN) notification for\n",

      "responded today to an independent review that confirmed that Michigan’s Department of Environmental Quality failed to\n",
      "ensure proper corrosion control was used to treat Flint River water and that the State was responsible for the decision to use the\n",
      "river as the City of Flint’s primary drinking water source.\n",
      "\n",
      "The letter from the State Auditor General was the initial response to questions raised by Sen. Ananich in October. The Auditor\n",
      "General is working on a more thorough review and expects to have additional information in the coming months.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Auditor General has provided an important piece of this puzzle and I’m sure the extended report they are working on will\n",
      "reveal additional information,” Sen. Ananich said. “What’s clear is that corrosion control should have been used and there are\n",
      "serious failings in our system that must be addressed. Between the FOIA emails released recently and these findings, it’s\n",
      "obvious that legislative oversight is the best way to see how all of these pieces fit together. I expect holding hearings to be high\n",
      "on the agenda when the Legislature returns.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In response to the question about whether corrosion control treatment should have been maintained when the switch for the\n",

      "should have been maintained.”\n",

      "“Although the Flint City Council voted in March 2013 in support of moving to the KWA pipeline, the vote was silent on the\n",
      "use of Flint River water as a temporary drinking water source.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This is contrary to recent claims that somehow this local vote was in favor of using the river.\n",

      "it is,” Rep. Neeley said. “We need answers, we need action, and we need them sooner rather than later.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sen. Ananich and Rep. Neeley have been calling for legislative hearings and a more aggressive response since the Flint water\n",

      "Dear Congressman Kildee:\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you for your September 9, 2015, letter regarding your concerns for the drinking water\n",
      "in the city of Flint (Flint). The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) is\n",
      "working closely with Flint's water department as well as the U.S. Environmental Protection\n",
      "Agency (USEPA) to ensure Flint residents have ample water that meets state and federal\n",
      "drinking water standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "The MDEQ’s role is to administer its nearly 40-year-old state drinking water protection\n",
      "program based on federal guidelines. The MDEQ works with approximately 11,500 public\n",
      "water systems in the state to monitor for more than 90 primary drinking water contaminants\n",
      "and ensure that every supply consistently provides safe drinking water.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Flint, the city made a decision 18 months ago to switch drinking water sources. This\n",
      "change required them to take specific measures under the federal Lead and Copper Rule,\n",
      "which was enacted in 1991 to monitor water as it interacts with lead service connections\n",
      "and home plumbing. Flint's test results were conducted according to the same testing\n",
      "protocols every Michigan community uses and the same protocols Flint has used to test its\n",
      "water every three years for the past 25 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the results from Flint's testing show compliance with the federal action level for lead\n",
      "and copper, on August 17, 2015, the MDEQ instructed the city to move forward\n",
      "expeditiously with developing additional corrosion control treatment to minimize the\n",
      "corrosive effects between drinking water and lead service connections and home plumbing\n",
      "in the Flint service area.\n",

      "FLINT SCHOOL TESTING RESULTS:\n",
      "WHAT DID WE FIND?\n",
      "\n",
      "1) The results of the initial screening conducted over the course of the last week are consistent with the\n",
      "last round of community lead and copper testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) There were a total of 37 samples taken from 13 schools. Of those 37 samples, 4 exceeded the 15 ppb\n",
      "action level. There were 3 schools that had samples exceeding the action level: Eisenhower Elementary\n",
      "(which had two samples exceeding 15 ppb). Brownell STEM Academy and Freeman Elementary each\n",
      "had one sample exceeding 15 PPB. The sample from Freeman Academy was significantly higher than\n",
      "the other samples at 101 PPB.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Looking at the data from a health based perspective, the data clearly demonstrates that more\n",
      "detailed sampling needs to occur so that the various sources of lead contamination contained within\n",
      "each respective school’s plumbing can be identified and addressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "WHAT DOES THE DATA MEAN?\n",
      "\n",
      "1) The data underscores the need for a complete and thorough evaluation of the plumbing system\n",
      "within each school.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) We have developed a protocol for evaluating the plumbing systems and we will be working with\n",
      "schools to implement these protocols and to assist them in determining a corrective action plan to\n",
      "address this issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) The State is identifying staff within DEQ, DHHS, LARA and Local County Health Departments to assist\n",
      "schools in conducting evaluations of their plumbing systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "WHAT IS YOUR PROTOCOL?\n",
      "1) DEQ’s protocols are based on similar work done in Michigan and in other States.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Multiple samples from each tap used for cooking or drinking water will be collected at prescribed\n",
      "intervals to identify levels of lead and its likely source.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Once an evaluation is complete, we will be able to assist each School in developing a comprehensive\n",
      "plan to address issues on a site specific basis.\n",

      "How can lead get into drinking water?\n",

      "Lead detections in Flint drinking water exist at the home level. Sampling at the Flint\n",
      "Water Treatment Plant has shown no lead in its treated water. However, this\n",
      "contaminant leaches into water from a home’s lead service lines, lead solder, and\n",

      "Does the city meet federal drinking water standards for lead and copper?\n",
      "Yes, the city is meeting state and federal guidelines for lead and copper.\n",
      "\n",
      "The City of Flint has regularly monitored for lead and copper since federal law began\n",
      "requiring it in 1991.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the City changed water sources in May 2014, state and federal law required the\n",
      "city to sample for lead and copper for a full year to determine how the water may be\n",
      "interacting with residential lead plumbing to increase lead levels. While the city’s results\n",
      "show residential lead levels below the federal threshold for immediate response\n",
      "activities, Flint is moving quickly to optimize corrosion control measures in its water\n",
      "system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some individual homes showed high numbers for lead. Isn’t that a concern?\n",
      "\n",
      "For the homeowner, yes it is. There is no “safe” level for lead, and while the leading\n",
      "cause of lead poisoning around the country is lead paint, any source of lead ingestion is\n",
      "worthy of concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the State and federal guidelines for lead and copper acknowledge an important\n",
      "reality: Any home that has a lead service connection or lead plumbing will immpart some\n",
      "varying amount of lead into the home’s water. The only way to eliminate lead in a home\n",
      "water system is to remove lead plumbing or replace lead service connections to the city\n",
      "system.\n",

      "The lead and copper rule requires the local operator to sample dozens, sometimes\n",
      "hundreds of homes in the service area to get a general sense of how the water supply is\n",

      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Are there other ways the city monitors for lead exposure?\n",
      "\n",
      "The County Health Department, overseen statewide by the Michigan Department of\n",
      "Health and Human Services, regularly monitors blood levels in children throughout\n",
      "Michigan communities. The leading cause of lead poisoning is exposure to lead paint.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blood lead level testing results for the 12-month period just after the City of Flint\n",
      "changed its water source (May 2014 — April 2015) showed no significant change in the\n",
      "pattern of blood lead levels in Flint, compared to the previous three years. This data\n",
      "suggests the recent change in water source by the City of Flint has not contributed to an\n",
      "increase in lead exposure throughout the community.\n",
      "\n",
      "How does the state decide if the water is creating a lead problem?\n",
      "\n",
      "Compliance with the federal lead rule is based on a 90™ percentile calculation. If more\n",
      "than 10 percent of samples report lead above the federal action level of 15 parts per\n",
      "billion, a water supply has an “action level exceedance.” An exceedance is not a\n",
      "violation. It triggers other requirements which could include public notification, additional\n",
      "water quality sampling, and possibly further treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "While some of Flint's individual samples exceeded the 15 parts-per-billion lead action\n",
      "level, compliance is based on the 90™ percentile of samples. The City of Flint's 90\n",
      "percentile level has ranged between 0 parts per billion in 2008 and 2011, and 15 parts\n",
      "per billion in 1992, but never exceeded the action level.\n",
      "\n",

      "The more time water has been sitting in your home's pipes, the more lead it may\n",
      "contain. When water in a particular faucet has not been used for six hours or longer,\n",
      "\"flush\" cold-water pipes by running the water until it becomes as cold as it will get. This\n",
      "could take five to 30 seconds if there has been recent water use elsewhere in the home,\n",
      "such as showering or flushing toilets. Otherwise, it could take two minutes or longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Use only water from the cold-water tap for drinking, cooking, and especially for making\n",

      "\n",
      "Replacement of service pipes on private property and any leaded plumbing materials\n",
      "within the home is a homeowner’s responsibility. The City of Flint owns the service\n",
      "pipe from the water main to the curb stop valve, and that is the City’s responsibility.\n",
      "This valve is normally located two feet in from the street curb. From there to the house\n",
      "is private property and the responsibility of the homeowner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why doesn’t the city at least replace its portion of lead service lines?\n",
      "\n",
      "Partial lead service line replacement has been shown to mobilize more lead and make\n",
      "the situation worse. Only full lead service line replacement has been demonstrated\n",
      "effective in achieving long-term reductions in drinking water lead levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the City’s timeline for installation of corrosion control treatment?\n",
      "\n",
      "The federal government allows the steps to complete the installation of optimal\n",
      "corrosion control treatment and follow-up monitoring to take up to five years.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the City of Flint has committed to completing installation of Optimized\n",

      "What will happen when Flint joins the Karegnondi Water Authority next year?\n",
      "The City has committed to having Optimized Corrosion Control Treatment in place prior\n",
      "to its connection with the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA). The water provided by\n",
      "KWA will come from a new source, Lake Huron. The city will continue its lead and\n",

      "How long would it take to replace lead service lines throughout Flint?\n",
      "\n",
      "The city has about 32,900 service connections in total. More than 15,000 of these\n",
      "connections are considered lead service lines. Even if many crews were contracted, it\n",
      "would likely take up to 15 years to complete this work.\n",
      "\n",
      "What would it cost to replace the lead service line at my house?\n",
      "\n",
      "Average costs to replace a lead service line at an individual home range from $2,000 to\n",
      "$8,000. Costs vary depending on the length and size of service line that is needed, as\n",

      "Thank you for your September 9, 2015, letter regarding your concerns for the drinking water\n",

      "working closely with Flint's water department as well as the U.S. Environmental Protection\n",
      "Agency (USEPA) to ensure Flint residents have ample water that meets state and federal\n",
      "drinking water standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "The MDEQ’s role is to administer its nearly 40-year-old state drinking water protection\n",
      "program based on federal guidelines. The MDEQ works with approximately 11,500 public\n",
      "water systems in the state to monitor for more than 90 primary drinking water contaminants\n",
      "and ensure that every supply consistently provides safe drinking water.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Flint, the city made a decision 18 months ago to switch drinking water sources. This\n",
      "change required them to take specific measures under the federal Lead and Copper Rule,\n",
      "which was enacted in 1991 to monitor water as it interacts with lead service connections\n",
      "and home plumbing. Flint's test results were conducted according to the same testing\n",
      "protocols every Michigan community uses and the same protocols Flint has used to test its\n",
      "water every three years for the past 25 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the results from Flint's testing show compliance with the federal action level for lead\n",
      "and copper, on August 17, 2015, the MDEQ instructed the city to move forward\n",
      "expeditiously with developing additional corrosion control treatment to minimize the\n",
      "corrosive effects between drinking water and lead service connections and home plumbing\n",
      "in the Flint service area.\n",

      "WHAT DID WE FIND?\n",
      "\n",
      "1) The results of the initial screening conducted over the course of the last week are consistent with the\n",
      "last round of community lead and copper testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) There were a total of 37 samples taken from 13 schools. Of those 37 samples, 4 exceeded the 15 ppb\n",
      "action level. There were 3 schools that had samples exceeding the action level: Eisenhower Elementary\n",
      "(which had two samples exceeding 15 ppb). Brownell STEM Academy and Freeman Elementary each\n",
      "had one sample exceeding 15 PPB. The sample from Freeman Academy was significantly higher than\n",
      "the other samples at 101 PPB.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Looking at the data from a health based perspective, the data clearly demonstrates that more\n",
      "detailed sampling needs to occur so that the various sources of lead contamination contained within\n",
      "each respective school’s plumbing can be identified and addressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "WHAT DOES THE DATA MEAN?\n",
      "\n",
      "1) The data underscores the need for a complete and thorough evaluation of the plumbing system\n",
      "within each school.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) We have developed a protocol for evaluating the plumbing systems and we will be working with\n",
      "schools to implement these protocols and to assist them in determining a corrective action plan to\n",
      "address this issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) The State is identifying staff within DEQ, DHHS, LARA and Local County Health Departments to assist\n",
      "schools in conducting evaluations of their plumbing systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "WHAT IS YOUR PROTOCOL?\n",
      "1) DEQ’s protocols are based on similar work done in Michigan and in other States.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Multiple samples from each tap used for cooking or drinking water will be collected at prescribed\n",
      "intervals to identify levels of lead and its likely source.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Once an evaluation is complete, we will be able to assist each School in developing a comprehensive\n",

      "Some individual homes showed high numbers for lead. Isn’t that a concern?\n",
      "\n",
      "For the homeowner, yes it is. There is no “safe” level for lead, and while the leading\n",
      "cause of lead poisoning around the country is lead paint, any source of lead ingestion is\n",
      "worthy of concern.\n",

      "The County Health Department, overseen statewide by the Michigan Department of\n",
      "Health and Human Services, regularly monitors blood levels in children throughout\n",
      "Michigan communities. The leading cause of lead poisoning is exposure to lead paint.\n",

      "\n",
      "How does the state decide if the water is creating a lead problem?\n",
      "\n",
      "Compliance with the federal lead rule is based on a 90™ percentile calculation. If more\n",
      "than 10 percent of samples report lead above the federal action level of 15 parts per\n",
      "billion, a water supply has an “action level exceedance.” An exceedance is not a\n",

      "water quality sampling, and possibly further treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "While some of Flint's individual samples exceeded the 15 parts-per-billion lead action\n",
      "level, compliance is based on the 90™ percentile of samples. The City of Flint's 90\n",
      "percentile level has ranged between 0 parts per billion in 2008 and 2011, and 15 parts\n",

      "\n",
      "The more time water has been sitting in your home's pipes, the more lead it may\n",
      "contain. When water in a particular faucet has not been used for six hours or longer,\n",
      "\"flush\" cold-water pipes by running the water until it becomes as cold as it will get. This\n",
      "could take five to 30 seconds if there has been recent water use elsewhere in the home,\n",
      "such as showering or flushing toilets. Otherwise, it could take two minutes or longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Use only water from the cold-water tap for drinking, cooking, and especially for making\n",

      "\n",
      "Replacement of service pipes on private property and any leaded plumbing materials\n",
      "within the home is a homeowner’s responsibility. The City of Flint owns the service\n",
      "pipe from the water main to the curb stop valve, and that is the City’s responsibility.\n",
      "This valve is normally located two feet in from the street curb. From there to the house\n",
      "is private property and the responsibility of the homeowner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why doesn’t the city at least replace its portion of lead service lines?\n",
      "\n",
      "Partial lead service line replacement has been shown to mobilize more lead and make\n",
      "the situation worse. Only full lead service line replacement has been demonstrated\n",
      "effective in achieving long-term reductions in drinking water lead levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the City’s timeline for installation of corrosion control treatment?\n",
      "\n",
      "The federal government allows the steps to complete the installation of optimal\n",
      "corrosion control treatment and follow-up monitoring to take up to five years.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the City of Flint has committed to completing installation of Optimized\n",
      "Corrosion Control Treatment in less than six months.\n",
      "\n",
      "What will happen when Flint joins the Karegnondi Water Authority next year?\n",
      "The City has committed to having Optimized Corrosion Control Treatment in place prior\n",
      "to its connection with the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA). The water provided by\n",
      "KWA will come from a new source, Lake Huron. The city will continue its lead and\n",
      "copper sampling every six months. Additionally, the city's water treatment plant will\n",
      "continue to operate with uninterrupted Optimized Corrosion Control Treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "How long would it take to replace lead service lines throughout Flint?\n",
      "\n",
      "The city has about 32,900 service connections in total. More than 15,000 of these\n",
      "connections are considered lead service lines. Even if many crews were contracted, it\n",
      "would likely take up to 15 years to complete this work.\n",
      "\n",
      "What would it cost to replace the lead service line at my house?\n",
      "\n",
      "Average costs to replace a lead service line at an individual home range from $2,000 to\n",
      "$8,000. Costs vary depending on the length and size of service line that is needed, as\n",
      "well as the ground cover and soil conditions encountered.\n",
