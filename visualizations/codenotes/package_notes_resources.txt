This package isn't really designed with the intent to display the data we are trying to display, which is why it is
important for the frequency data to be generated in R. I played with the idea of using D3 to make a heatmap for a while,
and also tried using a few other packages and some ggplot2 methods, but these proved more difficult and required an
extensive restructuring of the data. Openair proved to be the smoothest possible transition from JSON to heatmap, in that
it already had a base calendar format. The only catch is the date format must be Y-m-d, so the conversion from UNIX
is mandatory. The frequency data here serves as the pollutant, which could serve to create some confusion in the future,
but in all generated tests thus far the output has been true to the dataset.

Openair takes more arguments than my code uses, so further customization of the output is possible. Until the final version
of the calendars is created, however, the default is clean enough to serve its purpose. While not the most customizable
calendar, and lacking things like tooltip or zoom capability, the openair package packs the most value in only a few lines
of code. What will be needed in the future is a method for layering functionality over top of the output.


DT

This package is incredibly straightforward and customizable. Of all the searchable tables I have created using R, this one
is easily the most efficient and easy to understand. While D3 might prove itself more efficient once the database is active
for creating another searchable table, DT could still prove useful and functional for creating tables as well because it is
so highly customizable. These kinds of decisions will need to be made after the database is created.
