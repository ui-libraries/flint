Instructions for creating searchable datatables in R

Packages needed
DT
htmlwidgets

Step 1: import the data
> tableData = read.csv("file/path")

Step 2: create the table
> datatable(tableData, filter = "top", rownames = FALSE)

Step 3: create the widget
If you want to make the table into a widget, just name it and then use the saveWidget function.
> TableOut = datatable(tableData, filter = "top", rownames = FALSE)
> saveWidget(TableOut, file = "TableOut.html")

These tables are crazy easy to make with the DT package. Just make sure you name your tables something clear so you know which ones are which.
